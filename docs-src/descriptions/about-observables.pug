h2#about-observables Intro to Streams and Properties

p.
  Kefir supports two types of observables â€” streams and properties.
  Streams represent sequences of events made available over time. And properties represent
  values that change over time. The value of a property changes in response to events,
  which means that any stream may be easily converted to a property.

p.
  In practice, the only difference between the two types of observables
  is that properties may have a current value. The process of subscribing
  to both types of observables is the same: you call the #[a(href='#on-value') onValue]
  method, passing a callback function to it. But when you subscribe
  to a property which has a current value, the callback is called
  immediately (synchronously) with the current value of the property.
